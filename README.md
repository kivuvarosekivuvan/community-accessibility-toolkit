### 📊 Admin Dashboard  
**Only for admins:** View every feedback submission in a comprehensive table that includes timestamp, feedback text, category, rating, sentiment label, and sentiment score. Filter by category or sentiment, page through results, view summary cards, and even export all feedback as CSV. This helps administrators see trends at a glance and dive deep into user insights.

### 🌗 Dark Mode Toggle  
Your comfort matters! A Dark Mode option is built into the sidebar (click the moon icon) so you can switch themes without leaving the page.

### 🌍 Multilingual Accessibility  
We believe accessibility knows no borders. That’s why our toolkit is available in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Swahili, and Sheng. Everyone deserves access to information in a language they understand and feel comfortable with.
